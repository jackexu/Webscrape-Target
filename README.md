# Webscrape-Target
Use Python to scrape Target website and notify whenever item (like Nintendo Switch) is in stock in store.

## Find your store id

If you have multi stores nearby, and you want to select one of them - either input store zipcode or find the store id in the script.

## Email notification

You can run this one in Cloud (Google Cloud, AWS, Azure, etc) and write a function to send your an email whenever it is in stock. 

Or you can use the `email_function` in this repo - **_MAKE SURE_** you remove your password before show/send to others

Set the time to 300 seconds or whatever you want.
